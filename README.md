#### Version 1.0 Beta

This is the first and latest release of tddtnews. It is rough around the edges and may be full of bugs. Despite this, it works for a lot of situations and will be extensively tested before releasing the alpha version

##### Features:
- auto-updating preview that lets you see what the newsletter looks like before you publish
- automatically searches out for events in the next 2 months, so no need to manually type those events in
- an image hoster function is included, which automatically uploads public images to your google drive (adding images to the newsletter will be added in a later update)
- a news adder function lets you easily add your own written sections to the newsletter

#### Installing Dependencies
I haven't tested these steps on a different device, but in theory, this is how you would run the application

1. install poetry following instructions at https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation
2. open **cmd** and run `git clone https://github.com/wuben2602/tddtnews.git` (needs a github account)
3. navigate to the folder created by step 2 and run `tddtgui.bat` in windows or `tddtgui.sh` in mac/linux
